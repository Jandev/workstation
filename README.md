# Developer workstation

This repository contains the templates & scripts to run a (developer) workstation within Microsoft Azure.
These files are complementary to the blogpost I've written about it, which can be found over here <https://jan-v.nl/post/2020/developing-in-an-azure-virtualmachine/>

## What about Azure Virtual Desktop?

Nowadays, using [Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/#overview) might be a better solution to set all of this up.  
Try that out first and if you're not happy with the AVD experience, you can always use a seperate VM.
